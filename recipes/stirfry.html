        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Here we have a recipe for a (relatively) healthy stirfry dish. It's a simple dish, easy to throw together, and not too time consuming.</p>
        <p>Perfect if you are in the mood for something healthy, with plenty of yummy veggies.</p>
        <p>In the next section, we go over the ingredients you'll need.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A block of extra firm tofu</li>
            <li>Veggie or canola oil</li>
            <li>1 Yellow or white onion</li>
            <li>1 Bellpepper</li>
            <li>A head of broccoli</li>
            <li>A cup of shredded red cabbage</li>
            <li>Carrots</li>
            <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>A tablespoon of ginger</li>

            <li>Seasame oil</li>
            <li>Optional: A cup of white rice</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We believe in variety, so feel free to swap out the veggies with something you prefer! Can be served on a bed of white rice, or as is.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the tofu into 1 to 2 inch cubes. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Dice all veggies. Dice garlic and ginger separately and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat up your wok, or saucepan, on medium to high heat.</li>
            <li>Once pan is hot, pour in a tablespoon of veggie oil.</li>
            <li>Add tofu to the pan. Stir and cook until all sides are a light brown, or tannish color.</li>
            <li>Once golden, remove tofu from pan.</li>
            <li>Add another tablespoon of vegetable oil to the pan/wok.</li>
            <li>Add vegetables to the pan. Sautee, stirring as needed.</li>
            <li>Once vegetables begin to soften, after three minutes or so, add in the diced garlic and ginger.</li>
            <li>After two to three minutes, return tofu to the pan.</li>
            <li>Pour in 2 to 3 tablespoons of soysauce, stirring to make sure tofu and vegetables are coated.</li>
            <li>Add in chili flakes.</li>
            <li>Remove food from pan. Drizzle a teaspoon of seasame oil ontop for additional flavor.</li>
            <li>All done! You should have a nice bowl of stirfry ready for the eating.</li>
        </ol>
