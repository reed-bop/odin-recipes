        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>The only ingredient you really need is a potato, but we have included a list of our favorite toppings in this recipe.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One russet potato</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Sour cream</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Green onion/chives</li>
            <li>Bacon bits</li>
            <li>Shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Instructions/Steps, ol  -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</li>
            <li>Rinse the potato, scrubbing away any dirt.</li>
            <li>Pat the potato dry with a towel.</li>
            <li>With a fork, poke holes on one side of the potato. This prevents your potato from bursting in the oven.</li>
            <li>Once the oven has finished preheating, place the potato directly on the oven rack.</li>
            <li>It should take roughly 50 minutes to an hour for the potato to bake.</li>
            <li>You can test if it is done by giving it a squeeze with a pair of tongs, or your hand in an oven mitt. There should be some "give", or softness, that lets you know the potato is adequately baked.</li>
            <li>Remove the potato from the oven and place on a plate. Turn off the oven.</li>
            <li>After the potato has cooled for a couple of minutes, make a slit along the top of the potato from end to end, lengthwise.</li>
            <li>Add butter, seasonings, and toppings.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
